What is this?
=============

This project contains a bunch of js "components" built on top of [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3).
Currently this is a copy-paste of code used in [code history mining](https://github.com/dkandalov/code-history-mining).

In the future it would be great to make it a proper js library
hopefully with components which can be combined with each other in many different ways.


How to play with it?
====================
 - clone the project
 - open locally ```chart-example.html``` or ```graph-example.html```
 - use ```specs/SpecRunner.html``` to execute jasmine specs
